Popcorn API is developed to make it easier for anyone to create their own version of [Popcorn Time](http://popcorntime.sh). It contains:

- Metadata about movies (taken from Trakt).
- Metadata about TV shows and individual episodes (taken from Trakt).
- Metadata about anime shows (taken from Hummingbird).
- Multiple quality magnet links for every episode.
- Ability to easily filter content to the user's content.
- Add content manually through the CLI.
